## Overview

The Algorithmic Trading Platform is a sophisticated system that enables traders to build, backtest, and deploy complex trading strategies across multiple assets. Built with FastAPI and Next.js, it features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for strategy creation, comprehensive backtesting capabilities, and real-time market data integration. The platform connects to brokerage accounts like Charles Schwab and uses Polygon.io for streaming market data, making it a powerful tool for both retail and professional traders.

## Goals and Motivation

Algorithmic trading presents significant challenges for individual traders and smaller firms who need to:

- Create complex strategies with minimal coding
- Test strategies against historical data
- Monitor performance across multiple assets
- Execute trades automatically based on predefined rules
- Manage risk with sophisticated controls

While professional trading platforms exist, they often lack flexibility or require extensive programming knowledge. This platform bridges this gap by providing an intuitive interface for developing intricate trading strategies while maintaining professional-grade performance and reliability.

## Technology Stack

- Strategy evaluation optimization

Our solution involved:

- Asynchronous processing pipelines
- Strategic data caching
- Selective indicator calculation

### Trade Execution Reliability

Ensuring reliable trade execution presented critical challenges:

- Managing API rate limits
- Handling partial fills and rejections
- Maintaining state during disconnections

We addressed these by:

- Implementing a robust state machine for orders
- Creating retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Building comprehensive logging and alerting

## Future Enhancements

### Machine Learning Integration

Planning to add AI-powered features:

- Strategy optimization suggestions
- Anomaly detection in market data
- Predictive performance modeling
- Parameter optimization

### Enhanced Risk Management

Expanding risk control capabilities:

- Portfolio-level risk metrics
- Automatic stop adjustment
- Volatility-based position sizing
- Correlation-based exposure management

### Social Trading

Building collaborative features:

- Strategy marketplace
